# Assessing Super-Resolution Techniques for Efficient Upscaling of AI-Generated Images 

## Overview

This repository contains all of the code and data files used for the generation, validation and analysis of the COMP820 Course. This project looks to generate super-resolution (SR) image,  validate quality of the image generated by the SR model; then provide an analysis on the values

## Structure
- `analysis.py` - This is the a script that will be used to analyze the results of the validation
- `main.py` - This is the main script that will be used to run the validation for all the images
- `./validations` - This is the folder that will contain all the scripts for each type of validation
- `./super_resolution` - This is the folder that will contain all the super resolution model for the image generation
-  `./data` - This is the folder that will contain all the data for the validation
- `./plots` - This is the folder that will contain all the plots for the validation that are generated by the `analysis.py` script

# Usage

To reproduce the analysis from the paper, do the following:
- Install UV in your local machine.
- Run `uv run python main.py` for comparing all the images already generated.
- Run `uv run python analysis.py` for all the analysis done in the paper.


## Development
- Add dependencies using `uv add <package>`
- Remove dependencies using `uv remove <package>`
- Reinstall dependencies from lock file using `uv sync`
